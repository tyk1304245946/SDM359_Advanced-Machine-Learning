Both functions satisfy the core requirements of a **sigmoid function**: they are smooth, monotonically increasing, S-shaped curves with horizontal asymptotes. Below is a breakdown of their properties and differences:

### **1. Normal Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**
- **Expression**:
  $$
  \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2} \, dt
  $$
- **Properties**:
  - **Asymptotes**: Approaches $0$ as $x \to -\infty$ and $1$ as $x \to +\infty$.
  - **Derivative**: Gaussian PDF ($e^{-x^2/2}/\sqrt{2\pi}$), which decays **exponentially**.
  - **Symmetry**: $\phi(-x) = 1 - \phi(x)$.
  - **Range**: Strictly bounded between $0$ and $1$.

### **2. Scaled Arctangent Function**
- **Expression**:
  $$
  \phi(x) = \frac{2}{\pi} \tan^{-1}(x)
  $$
- **Properties**:
  - **Asymptotes**: Approaches $-1$ as $x \to -\infty$ and $1$ as $x \to +\infty$.
  - **Derivative**: $\frac{2}{\pi(1 + x^2)}$, which decays **polynomially** (like $1/x^2$).
  - **Symmetry**: $\phi(-x) = - \phi(x)$ about the origin point.
  - **Range**: Spans $-1$ to $1$.

### **Key Differences**
| Property                | Normal CDF                          | Arctangent Function                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Asymptotic Values**   | $0$ to $1$                          | $-1$ to $1$                         |
| **Tail Behavior**       | Light tails (exponential decay)     | Heavy tails (polynomial decay)      |
| **Convergence Rate**    | Faster approach to asymptotes       | Slower approach to asymptotes       |
| **Derivative Decay**    | Gaussian (sharp drop-off)           | Rational (gentler drop-off)         |

### **Conclusion**
Both functions are sigmoidal due to their S-shape and smooth monotonicity, but they differ in asymptotic bounds, tail behavior, and convergence rates. The normal CDF is bounded in $[0, 1]$ with exponential decay, while the arctangent variant spans a wider range with polynomial decay.
